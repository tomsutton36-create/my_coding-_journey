  <h1>My coding journey</h1>
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>My name is Tom, I am a service engineer by trade working on professional audio equipment but I have always been interested in coding.
     This project is designed to be an example of my work and will change and progress as I learn more. 
	 I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript in late November 2025 with a very basic understanding of HTML and no experience with CSS or JavaScript.</p>
