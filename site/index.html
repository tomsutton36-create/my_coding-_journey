  <h1>My coding journey</h1>
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>My name is Tom, I am a service engineer by trade working on professional audio equipment but I have always been interested in coding.
     This project is designed to be an example of my work and will change and progress as I learn more. 
	 I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the <a target ="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">FreeCodeCamp</a> curriculum in late November 2025 with a very basic understanding of HTML and no experience with CSS or JavaScript.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>Below are links to the projects I have created using HTML only</p>
   <h3>Build a Curriculum Outline</h3>
   <a target="_blank" href="Curriculum_outline.html"><button class="btn">Curriculum Outline
   </button></a>
   <p>This is the very first project I built, it is a very basic static webpage only utilising the &lth1&gt, &lth2&gt and &ltp&gt elements of HTML</p>
   <p>As you can see, this project was very simple but I found it to be an enjoyable first task in the course. 
I like that I was able to see code that I had written working, it gave me a sense of achievment and gave me a rush of motivation.</p>
   <p>Below is the source code for this project, there's not much to it but it works</p>
	<a target="_blank" href="Curriculum_outlinesc.txt"><button class="btn">Source Code</button></a>
    <h3>Build a cat photo app</h3>
	<a target="_blank" href="CatPhotoApp.html"><button class="btn">Cat Photo App</button></a>
  <p>The second project was to build a simple cat photo app. This was the first introduction to adding images to a page using the &lta&gt anchor element, making clicked links open in a new tab, adding sources via the "src" attribute and working with the "alt" attribute for accesibility purposes.
  I was also introduced to the use of the &ltul&gt (unordered, bulleted list), &ltol&gt (ordered, numbered list) and &ltli&gt (list item) elements.
  The &ltfigure&gt and &ltfigcaption&gt elements were used in this project to caption pictures on the page.</p>
  <p>The source code below shows that this was more complicated than the Curriculum Outline project.</p>
   <a target="_blank" href="catappsc.txt"><button class="btn">Source Code</button></a>
   <h3>Build a Bookstore page</h3>
   <a target="_blank" href="bookstore_page.html"><button class="btn">Bookstore page</button></a>
   <p>This project introduced the &ltbutton&gt element used to create buttons on a page, combined with the anchor (&lta&gt) element and it's attributes <em>target</em> and <em>href</em> to link it to a resource.
  The buttons in this project don't actually link to anything but it was good to learn how to set them up. The &ltdiv&gt element was also introduced at this point, it doesn't do anything until it is styled using CSS but it can be used to divide your content.</p>
