  <h1>My coding journey</h1>
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>My name is Tom, I am a service engineer by trade working on professional audio equipment but I have always been interested in coding.
     This project is designed to be an example of my work and will change and progress as I learn more. 
	 I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the <a target ="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">FreeCodeCamp</a> curriculum in late November 2025 with a very basic understanding of HTML and no experience with CSS or JavaScript.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>Below are links to the projects I have created using HTML only</p>
   
   <h3>Build a Curriculum Outline</h3>
   <a target="_blank" href="Curriculum_outline.html"><button class="btn">Curriculum Outline
   </button></a>
   <p>This is the very first project I built, it is a very basic static webpage only utilising the &lth1&gt, &lth2&gt and &ltp&gt elements of HTML</p>
   <p>As you can see, this project was very simple but I found it to be an enjoyable first task in the course. 
I like that I was able to see code that I had written working, it gave me a sense of achievment and gave me a rush of motivation.</p>

	<h3>Build a cat photo app</h3>
	<a target="_blank" href="CatPhotoApp.html"><button class="btn">Cat Photo App</button></a>
  <p>The second project was to build a simple cat photo app. This was the first introduction to adding images to a page using the &lta&gt anchor element, making clicked links open in a new tab, adding sources via the <strong><em>src</em></strong> attribute and working with the <strong><em>alt</em></strong> attribute for accesibility purposes.
  I was also introduced to the use of the &ltul&gt (unordered, bulleted list), &ltol&gt (ordered, numbered list) and &ltli&gt (list item) elements.
  The &ltfigure&gt and &ltfigcaption&gt elements were used in this project to caption pictures on the page.</p>

   <h3>Build a Bookstore page</h3>
   <a target="_blank" href="bookstore_page.html"><button class="btn">Bookstore page</button></a>
   <p>This project introduced the &ltbutton&gt element used to create buttons on a page, combined with the anchor (&lta&gt) element and it's attributes <strong><em>target</em></strong> and <strong><em>href</em></strong> to link it to a resource.
  The buttons in this project don't actually link to anything but it was good to learn how to set them up. The &ltdiv&gt element was also introduced at this point, it doesn't do anything until it is styled using CSS but it can be used to divide your content.</p>

  <h3>Build an audio and video player</h3>
  <a target="_blank" href="video-audio-player.html"><button class="btn">Audio Video Player</button></a>
  <p>This project introduced the &ltaudio&gt and &ltvideo&gt elements used with various attributes, in this case <strong><em>width</em></strong> which determines the width of the video player on the page, <strong><em>controls</em></strong> which allows the user to control the video or audio player and <strong><em>loop</em></strong> which, in this case, loops the audio file</p>
  <a target="_blank" href="video-audio-playersc.txt"><button class="btn">Source Code</button></a>
  
  <h3> Build a heart icon</h3>
  <a target="_blank" href="heart-icon.html"><button class="btn">Heart Icon</button></a>
  <p>In this project I worked with the &ltsvg&gt element and the attributes <strong><em>width</em></strong> and <strong><em>height</em></strong> to determine the width and the height of the icon but also <strong><em>viewbox</em></strong> to set the size of the viewbox where the icon will be displayed, if this is set to be smaller than the icon then part or all of the icon will not show up. I also used the attribute <strong><em>fill</em></strong> to fill the icon with colour, in this case red.See the source code which shows the path that is drawn to create the icon.</p>
